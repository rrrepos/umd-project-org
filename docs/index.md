{: .subtitle }
In today's visual world, we mostly express ourselves using different multimedia components. 

**Education**: Content in the training and education domain is usually a combination of media. The following can very easily be put together in an UMD document. 
* An image with an accompanying audio.
* A video link with an accompaning text summary.
* A PDF document with an accompaning assessment.
* Some text followed by an image with a video link and a concluding PDF.

**Brochures**: Grabbing the attention of your target groups is always a challenge. UMDs would be the perfect format for marketing collateral that has a combination of videos + text + pdf content.

**Blogs**: If you wish to put together your thoughts with accompanying multimedia including images + audio + video, and wish to share it privately, UMD is the ideal candidate.
